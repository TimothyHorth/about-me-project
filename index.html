        <p class="card-content">Going to the gym is my escape from the stresses of life. I enjoy the continual challenge 
          of progressing in my level of fitness and health. Resistance training has always been my favorite, while I usually
          delay cardio exercises until the next day...and the next day.</p>

        <p class="card-content">Eating has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, but I also like knowing what exactly I'm 
          putting into my body. Cooking has allowed me to continue eating the foods I like while ensuring that they aren't 
          overly harmful to my health or fitness goals.</p>

        <p class="card-content">I've always enjoyed a good book, whether fiction or non-fiction. Knowledge is power, and
          books have always provided me with loads of information. </p>

          and modify existing code, but creating my own programs has always been the most rewarding.</p>
